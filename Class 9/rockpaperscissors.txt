MY PSEUDOCODE

hand_in_fist = rock
two_fingers = scissors
hand_flat = paper
win = rock_hits_scissors or scissors_cut_paper or paper_covers_rock

if rock + scissors
	then rock_hits_scissors
else if scissors + paper
	then scissors_cut_paper
else if paper + rock
	then paper_covers_rock

	then repeat

SOLUTION PSEUDOCODE

available moves = "rock", "paper", "scissors"
 <!--This is a set of data... a list-->
you_win_text = "You win, good job!"

<!--then could add something like: if language = "spanish" / you_win_text = "tu ganas" and then you wouldn't have to change it all over the program-->

user_move = get move from user <!--pseudocode way of saying "get a move from the user"->
computer_move = generate move <!--different piece of code that randomly picks a move-->

<!--error handling: users will do the wrong thing...-->
if user_move is not in available_moves
	then print "That's not a valid move!"
else if user_move == computer_move
	then print "It's a tie!"
